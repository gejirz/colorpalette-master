# colorpalette-master
Scripts for generating a color palette out of an image, based on median cut algorithm. Used in my college project PixPalette.
## The tasks I had were: 
>- To generate a palette out of a given picture.
>- To write a wrapper for my script, which will compose my palette with the given picture into a single image.

## For that I created a package called "colorpalette-master":

### Install it via pip:
`pip install colorpalette-master`

## Compiling requirements:
>- Skimage (ver '0.19.3' or bigger)
>- Numpy (ver '1.21.6' or bigger)
>- PIL (ver '9.2.0' or bigger)

## Running requirements:
>- Python 3.7.7

### For the installation follow these steps:
>- Copy the folder into side-packages of your python interpreter
>- Import it into the script using "Import color_palette_MASTER"
>- Check the documentation inside it for additional information about the functions
